Keep the README and /project-docs always up to date (goals, architecture, steps, data dictionary).

Before each terminal command, briefly explain its purpose and expected effect; then execute it.

Use agent capabilities: create files, modify multiple files, run tests, fix errors.

Ask only if something is security-relevant; otherwise, carry out the steps deterministically.

After each major step, provide a brief status summary of what was created/changed.
